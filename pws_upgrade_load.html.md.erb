title: Upgrade Load Example&#58; Pivotal Web Services
owner: CloudOps
---

This topic provides sample performance measurements of a <%= vars.platform_name %> installation undergoing the workload associated with an upgrade.

To obtain these measurements, Pivotal repaved its production Pivotal Web Services (PWS) deployment. The repave process simulates system load that would be incurred when performing a rolling upgrade of Diego Cells.

Use the measurements and configuration values published in this document as guidance when ensuring you have adequate file storage hardware prior to a platform upgrade.

For more information about the impact of upgrade on file storage performance, see [Configure File Storage](configuring.html#file-storage) in _Configuring PAS for Upgrades_.


## <a id="configuration"></a> Platform Configuration

The following table details the starting parameters and configuration of PWS.

| Configuration | Value | How to Locate |
| ------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| IaaS | Amazon Web Services | See your BOSH Director configuration or BOSH deployment manifest. |
| File Storage | AWS EBS (External with some elastic capacity) | See your Pivotal Application Service (PAS) configuration or BOSH deployment manifest. |
| Version of Cloud Foundry (CF) | v252 | See your BOSH Director and TAS for VMs configuration or BOSH deployment manifest. |
| Number of Diego Cells | 218 | To view the number of Diego Cell instances currently running in your deployment, see the **Resource Config** pane of your TAS for VMs tile or consult your Diego deployment manifest. |
| Maximum number of started containers | 250 | For more information, see [Set a Maximum Number of Starting Containers](configuring.html#container-starts) in _Configuring TAS for VMs for Upgrades_. |
| `max_in_flight` Configuration for Diego Cells | 6 | To retrieve the existing `max_in_flight` value for the Diego Cell job in BOSH Director, use the Ops Manager API. If you are running open source CF, consult your BOSH deployment manifest. |
| Number of Availability Zones (AZs) | 2 | See your PAS or BOSH deployment AZ configuration. |
| Number of app instances | 16231 | `datadog.nozzle.bbs.LRPsRunning` |
| Number of App Security Groups (ASGs) | 43 | As an admin user, run `cf security-groups`. For more information, see [App Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html). |


## <a id="during_upgrade"></a> System Performance Measurements During Diego Cell Repave

This table presents performance measurements taken during the Diego Cell repave.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> These measurements indicate the peak cumulative values of the entire system: 250 Diego Cells, ~15,000 app instances, and 2 AZs.</p>

Use these measurements as a baseline for expected system load during Diego Cell upgrade.

| Measurement | Value | Metric Used |
| ----------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Diego Cell CPU consumption | 36% | `bosh.healthmonitor.system.cpu.user` |
| Diego Cell memory consumption | ~50% | `bosh.healthmonitor.system.mem.percent` |
| Diego Cell I/O consumption (read) during normal operations | 43 read I/O operations per second | `aws.ebs.volume_read_ops` |
| Diego Cell I/O consumption (read) during upgrade | 1,943 read I/O operations per second | `aws.ebs.volume_read_ops` |
| Diego Cell I/O consumption (write) during normal operations | 2,166 write I/O operations per second | `aws.ebs.volume_write_ops` |
| Diego Cell I/O consumption (write) during upgrade | 21,000 write I/O operations per second | `aws.ebs.volume_write_ops` |
| Diego Cell network consumption (network out) during normal operations | ~1.25&nbsp;GB per minute | `aws.ec2.network_out` |
| Diego Cell network consumption (network out) during Upgrade | ~1.25&nbsp;GB per minute (no significant change) | `aws.ec2.network_out` |
| Diego Cell network consumption (network in) during normal operations | 2.11&nbsp;GB per minute | `aws.ec2.network_in` |
| Diego Cell network consumption (network in) during upgrade | 16.75&nbsp;GB per minute | `aws.ec2.network_in` |


## <a id="graph"></a> Sample Performance Graphs

These DataDog graphs represent a timeline visualization of read and write operations during the repave event.

### <a id="graph_readops"></a> Read I/O Operations

The read I/O operations sample was taken over 115 VMs and represent the number of read operations over 300 seconds for a single Diego Cell.

### <a id="graph_writeops"></a> Write I/O Operations

The write I/O operations sample was taken over 115 VMs and represent the number of read I/O operations over 300 seconds for a single Diego Cell.

<%= image_tag("pws_write_ops_upgrade.png", :alt => "Sample Write I/O Operations graph.") %>


## <a id="summary"></a> Summary

During the repave process, 250 Diego Cells were updated. The repave process took 6 hours overall, or about 3 hours for each AZ.
