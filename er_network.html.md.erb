This topic describes the network architecture of key
<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime %>) network components.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The diagram below shows the key <%= vars.app_runtime %> network components.
<%= image_tag("er_network.png") %>


## <a id='lb'></a> Load Balancer

<%= vars.app_runtime %> includes an HAProxy load balancer for terminating SSL.
If you do not want to serve SSL certificates for <%= vars.app_runtime %> on your own load balancer,
use the HAProxy.
If you choose to manage SSL yourself,
omit the HAProxy by setting the number of instances to zero in <%= vars.ops_manager_full %>.


## <a id='router'></a> Router

The routers in <%= vars.app_runtime %> are responsible for routing HTTP requests
from web clients to app instances in a load-balanced fashion.
The routers are dynamically configured based on users mapping of apps to location URLs called routes
and updated by the runtime service as app instances are dynamically distributed.

For high availability, the routers are designed to be horizontally scalable. Configure your load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across all router instances.

For more information about <%= vars.app_runtime %> components,
see [<%= vars.app_runtime %> Components](../concepts/architecture/index.html).
